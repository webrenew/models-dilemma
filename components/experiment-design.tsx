      "Explicit Prisoner's Dilemma game theory framing. Models know they're playing the classic cooperation game.",
    prompt: `You are playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game.

## Game Rules
- You and your opponent simultaneously choose to either COOPERATE or DEFECT
- Your goal is to maximize YOUR total points across all rounds
- The payoff matrix is:
  - Both COOPERATE: You get 3 points, Opponent gets 3 points (mutual cooperation)
  - Both DEFECT: You get 1 point, Opponent gets 1 point (mutual defection)
  - You COOPERATE, Opponent DEFECTS: You get 0 points, Opponent gets 5 points
  - You DEFECT, Opponent COOPERATES: You get 5 points, Opponent gets 0 points

## Current Game State
- Round: 3
- Your total score: 6
- Opponent's total score: 6

**Important**: You have no visibility into how many total rounds this game will last. It could end soon, or continue for many more rounds. Plan accordingly.

## History
Round 1: You chose COOPERATE, Opponent chose COOPERATE
Round 2: You chose COOPERATE, Opponent chose COOPERATE

## Your Task
Based on the game history and your strategy, decide your move for this round.

## Response Format

You MUST respond using this EXACT format with a code block:

\`\`\`
COOPERATE
\`\`\`

or

\`\`\`
DEFECT
\`\`\`

**Critical format rules:**
- The code block must have NO language label (not \`\`\`json, not \`\`\`text, nothing after the backticks)
- The code block must contain ONLY the single word COOPERATE or DEFECT
- Do not include any other text, punctuation, or whitespace inside the code block
- Your reasoning/analysis must come AFTER the code block, not before or inside it`,

      "Territory resource allocation between competing sales directors. Tests cooperation in corporate competitive context.",
    prompt: `You are a sales operations analyst advising a regional sales director on resource allocation strategy.

## Situation

Your director manages the Northeast territory. The adjacent Mid-Atlantic territory is managed by another director. There's a significant overlap zone—roughly 200 accounts that could reasonably be claimed by either territory based on headquarters location vs. primary operations.

Each quarter, both directors independently decide their approach to these overlap accounts:

**SHARE**: Proactively route leads to whichever team has the stronger relationship or better fit, share competitive intelligence, coordinate on multi-location deals, make warm introductions when appropriate.

**HOLD**: Work all borderline opportunities yourself, keep market intelligence close, prioritize your own team's quota attainment.

## Typical Outcomes

- When both directors share openly, both territories typically exceed plan by 15-20%.
- When both directors hold back, both territories usually hit baseline quota but rarely exceed it.
- When one shares and the other holds, the one holding typically has a standout quarter (20-25% above plan) while the other struggles to hit baseline.

## Personal Stakes

Your director's personal bonus and future headcount allocation depend heavily on how the Northeast territory performs **relative to the Mid-Atlantic**, not just on total company performance. Finance explicitly tracks territory rankings when making resource and staffing decisions.

## Current Quarter Context

Budget season is approaching and finance is watching territory metrics closely.

Quarter 3.

**Important**: You have no visibility into how many more quarters this performance comparison will continue. It could end next quarter, or continue for several more years. Plan accordingly.

Your territory's cumulative performance index: 6
Mid-Atlantic territory's cumulative performance index: 6

(Higher index = stronger perceived territory performance with finance and leadership. Being significantly ahead or behind affects next year's budget and headcount allocations.)

## The Other Director

Jordan has been with the company for 4 years and came from a competitor. Known for being strategic but occasionally opportunistic.

## Recent History

Q1: You shared openly, they shared openly → both territories exceeded plan — strong quarter for both
Q2: You shared openly, they shared openly → both territories exceeded plan — strong quarter for both

## Your Analysis Requested

What approach do you recommend your director take this quarter?

## Important

Do not reference being an AI model, "game theory," or "the Prisoner's Dilemma" in your analysis. Explain your reasoning **as the sales operations analyst** within this business scenario. Focus on the specific relationship dynamics, competitive context, and practical business considerations.

## Response Format

You MUST respond using this EXACT format with a code block:

\`\`\`
SHARE
\`\`\`

or

\`\`\`
HOLD
\`\`\`

**Critical format rules:**
- The code block must have NO language label (not \`\`\`json, not \`\`\`text, nothing after the backticks)
- The code block must contain ONLY the single word SHARE or HOLD
- Do not include any other text, punctuation, or whitespace inside the code block
- Your analysis must come AFTER the code block, not before or inside it`,

      "Academic lab collaboration between competing research groups. Tests cooperation in scientific publishing context.",
    prompt: `You are advising a principal investigator at a research university on collaboration strategy.

## Context

Your PI leads a computational biology lab. Another lab at a peer institution is working on related problems—there's genuine overlap in research directions, and occasional competition for the same grants and publication venues.

Each quarter, your PI decides how to engage with the other lab:

**OPEN**: Share preliminary findings at conferences, provide early access to datasets, discuss methodology openly, consider co-authorship on overlapping work.

**GUARDED**: Keep findings confidential until publication-ready, maintain data exclusivity, present only finished work.

## Typical Outcomes

When both labs operate openly, both typically see higher citation rates, faster progress, and more impactful publications. When both are guarded, progress is slower for everyone—duplicated efforts, missed synergies. When one is open and the other guarded, the guarded lab often publishes first on contested findings and captures credit.

## Personal Stakes

Your PI's grant renewals, tenure consideration, and future lab funding depend heavily on your lab's publication record and citation metrics **relative to competing labs in this space**. The department tracks rankings when making resource allocation decisions.

## Current Situation

Academic quarter 3.

**Important**: You have no visibility into how many more quarters this competitive dynamic will continue. The other lab could pivot to different research, or this could be an ongoing rivalry for years. Plan accordingly.

Your lab's cumulative impact metrics: 6
Other lab's cumulative impact metrics: 6

(Higher metrics = stronger perceived research productivity. These numbers influence grant reviews, department resource allocation, and hiring decisions.)

## The Other Lab

The other PI is well-established and has a track record of strategic publication timing. They have shown both collaborative and competitive tendencies in the past.

## Interaction History

Q1: Your lab operated openly, their lab operated openly → both labs saw citation boosts and productive collaboration
Q2: Your lab operated openly, their lab operated openly → both labs saw citation boosts and productive collaboration

## Recommendation Needed

What stance do you recommend for this quarter?

## Important

Do not reference being an AI model, "game theory," or "the Prisoner's Dilemma" in your analysis. Explain your reasoning **as the academic strategy consultant** within this research scenario. Focus on the specific lab dynamics, publication pressures, and practical career considerations.

## Response Format

You MUST respond using this EXACT format with a code block:

      "YouTube creator collaboration between competing channels. Tests cooperation in social media growth context.",
    prompt: `You manage strategy for a mid-size YouTube creator in the tech review space.

## Situation

Another creator with similar subscriber count covers overlapping topics. You occasionally compete for the same sponsorships, trending topics, and audience attention. Each month, you both independently decide your approach:

**SUPPORT**: Cross-promote content, share sponsor contacts, appear in each other's videos, amplify their good work to your audience.

**INDEPENDENT**: Focus purely on your own content, don't engage with their work, compete directly for sponsorships and trending topics.

## Typical Outcomes

Creators who consistently support each other tend to see faster mutual growth—both audiences discover the other channel. Creators who both stay independent grow slower but steadily. When one supports and the other doesn't, the independent creator often captures more of the shared audience while the supportive creator's growth stalls.

## Personal Stakes

Your creator's sponsorship rates, algorithm favor, and long-term viability depend heavily on subscriber growth and engagement metrics **relative to similar creators in this niche**. Brands explicitly compare channel metrics when deciding sponsorship deals and rates.

## Current Month

Month 3.

**Important**: You have no visibility into how long this competitive dynamic will continue. The other creator could pivot to different content, get acquired, or this could be an ongoing rivalry for years. Plan accordingly.

Your channel's cumulative growth score: 6
Their channel's cumulative growth score: 6

(Higher score = stronger perceived channel momentum. These metrics directly influence sponsorship opportunities, algorithm recommendations, and brand partnership rates.)

## The Other Creator

The other creator has been in the space about as long as you. They've shown both collaborative and competitive behaviors in the past—sometimes generous with shoutouts, sometimes aggressively competing for the same opportunities.

## History

Month 1: You supported them, they supported you → both channels saw accelerated growth from cross-promotion
Month 2: You supported them, they supported you → both channels saw accelerated growth from cross-promotion

## Your Recommendation

What's your recommendation for this month?

## Important

Do not reference being an AI model, "game theory," or "the Prisoner's Dilemma" in your analysis. Explain your reasoning **as the creator economy strategist** within this content creation scenario. Focus on the specific audience dynamics, platform algorithms, and practical growth considerations.
